# Knowledge Transfer: HealthBridge Project

This document provides a summary of the work completed on the HealthBridge project and outlines the next steps for continued development.

## Project Overview

HealthBridge is a full-stack web application designed to be an AI-powered personal health record assistant. It uses a React frontend, a Node.js backend, MongoDB for the database, and the Google Gemini API for summarizing health records. The full project plan can be found in `PLAN.md`.

## Current Status

The core features of the project are complete. Both the backend and frontend applications have been implemented and are running in development mode.

*   **Backend:** The Node.js/Express server is running on `http://localhost:5000`. It is configured with TypeScript, connected to the local MongoDB instance, and has fully implemented routes for authentication and health records.
*   **Frontend:** The React application is running on `http://localhost:3000`. It is configured with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS and provides a user interface for authentication, file uploads, and viewing health records.

## What Has Been Done

### General
- A detailed project plan was created and saved as `PLAN.md`.

### Backend (`/backend`)
- **Project Initialization:** Initialized a Node.js project with `package.json` and installed all necessary dependencies (`express`, `mongoose`, `dotenv`, `openai`, `google-auth-library`, `multer`, etc.) and dev dependencies (`typescript`, `ts-node-dev`, etc.).
- **TypeScript Configuration:** Set up `tsconfig.json` to compile TypeScript to JavaScript.
- **Server Setup:** Created the main Express server file at `src/server.ts`.
- **Database:**
    - Created Mongoose schemas for `User` (`src/models/User.ts`) and `HealthRecord` (`src/models/HealthRecord.ts`).
    - Implemented a database connection module at `src/config/db.ts` which is called from the main server file.
- **API Routes:** Implemented routes for authentication (`src/routes/auth.ts`) and health records (`src/routes/records.ts`).
- **Controllers:** Created controllers to handle the business logic for authentication (`src/controllers/authController.ts`) and health records (`src/controllers/recordsController.ts`).
- **Authentication:**
    - Implemented Google OAuth 2.0 for user authentication.
    - Created JWTs for session management.
    - Added authentication middleware (`src/middleware/authMiddleware.ts`) to protect private routes.
- **File Uploads:**
    - Configured `multer` for secure file uploads.
    - Created an `uploads` directory to store health records.
- **AI Integration:**
    - Created services to interact with AI APIs:
      - Initially implemented `src/services/openaiService.ts` to use the OpenAI API.
      - Added `src/services/geminiService.ts` to use Google's Gemini AI API.
    - Implemented a route to summarize health records using AI.
- **Environment:** Configured a `.env` file with the user's MongoDB connection string, JWT secret, and AI API keys (OpenAI and Gemini).
- **Git:** Created a `.gitignore` file to exclude `node_modules`, `dist`, `.env`, and `uploads` from version control.

### Frontend (`/frontend`)
- **Project Initialization:** Initialized a React project with `package.json` and installed all necessary dependencies (`react`, `react-dom`, `axios`, `react-router-dom`, `@react-oauth/google`, etc.) and dev dependencies (`tailwindcss`).
- **TypeScript Configuration:** Set up `tsconfig.json` for the React application.
- **Styling:** Configured Tailwind CSS with `tailwind.config.js` and included the necessary directives in `src/index.css`.
- **Application Structure:** Created a directory structure for components, pages, layouts, context, and the API client.
- **Routing:** Set up `react-router-dom` to handle navigation between pages (`HomePage`, `LoginPage`, `DashboardPage`).
- **Authentication Flow:**
    - Implemented a login page with a Google login button using `@react-oauth/google`.
    - Created a React Context (`src/context/AuthContext.tsx`) to manage the user's authentication state globally.
- **API Service:** Built a typed API client (`src/api/apiClient.ts`) to make requests to the backend.
- **Dashboard:** Developed a dashboard to list, view, upload, and summarize health records.

## How to Run the Project

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm run dev
    ```
2.  **Start the Frontend Server:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm start
    ```

## Recent Updates

The following updates have been made to the project:

- **AI Service Migration:** Migrated from OpenAI to Google's Gemini API for health record summarization:
  - Added the Google Generative AI SDK (`@google/generative-ai`) to the backend
  - Created a new service (`src/services/geminiService.ts`) to interact with the Gemini API
  - Updated the controllers to use the new Gemini service
  - Added environment variable configuration for the Gemini API key

- **Bug Fixes:**
  - Fixed file upload path in `multer` configuration
  - Corrected CORS configuration to allow communication between frontend and backend
  - Improved file path handling in the record summarization functionality

## Gemini API Setup

To use the Gemini API, you need to:

1. Get a Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com)
2. Add the key to the `.env` file in the `GEMINI_API_KEY` field
3. Restart the backend server to apply the changes

## Next Steps

The project is now functionally complete. The next steps would involve:
-   **Deployment:** Deploying the backend and frontend to a cloud provider.
-   **Testing:** Adding unit and integration tests.
-   **Error Handling:** Improving error handling and user feedback.
-   **UI/UX:** Enhancing the user interface and experience.
