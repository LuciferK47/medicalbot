# HealthBridge: Project Development Plan

This plan outlines the steps to build the HealthBridge application, a full-stack project using React, Node.js, MongoDB, and the OpenAI API.

## Phase 1: Foundational Setup &amp; Backend Development

The first phase focuses on setting up the project structure and building the core backend services.

1.  **Project Scaffolding:**
    *   Create a root `healthbridge` directory.
    *   Inside, create `backend` and `frontend` directories to separate the concerns of the server and the client application.

2.  **Backend (Node.js with Express &amp; TypeScript):**
    *   Initialize a Node.js project in the `backend` directory (`npm init -y`).
    *   Install dependencies: `express`, `mongoose`, `jsonwebtoken`, `dotenv`, `openai`, and dev dependencies: `@types/node`, `@types/express`, `typescript`, `ts-node-dev`.
    *   Set up `tsconfig.json` for the TypeScript compiler.
    *   Create the core Express server file (`src/server.ts`) with basic middleware.

3.  **Database Modeling (MongoDB with Mongoose):**
    *   Define Mongoose schemas for:
        *   `User`: To store user information from OAuth providers (e.g., `email`, `name`, `providerId`).
        *   `HealthRecord`: To store uploaded documents, their content, and the AI-generated summaries (`userId`, `fileName`, `content`, `summary`).

4.  **API Endpoint Design:**
    *   **Authentication (`/api/auth`):**
        *   `POST /google/callback`: Handle the callback from Google OAuth.
        *   `POST /apple/callback`: Handle the callback from Apple OAuth.
        *   `GET /me`: Fetch the currently authenticated user's profile.
    *   **Health Records (`/api/records`):**
        *   `POST /upload`: Securely upload a health record file.
        *   `GET /`: List all records for the authenticated user.
        *   `GET /:id`: Retrieve a single health record.
        *   `POST /:id/summarize`: Trigger the AI summarization process for a specific record.

## Phase 2: Frontend Development (React &amp; TypeScript)

This phase involves building the user interface and connecting it to the backend.

1.  **Frontend Setup:**
    *   Use Create React App with the TypeScript template to initialize the project in the `frontend` directory.
    *   Install dependencies: `axios` for API calls, `react-router-dom` for routing, and `tailwindcss`.
    *   Configure Tailwind CSS for styling.

2.  **Component Architecture:**
    *   **Pages:** `HomePage`, `LoginPage`, `DashboardPage`.
    *   **Layout:** `Navbar`, `Footer`, `MainLayout`.
    *   **Dashboard Components:** `RecordList`, `RecordViewer`, `SummaryDisplay`, `DataVisualizationChart`.
    *   **Common Components:** `Button`, `Spinner`, `Modal`.

3.  **Client-Side Logic:**
    *   **Authentication Flow:** Implement the logic to handle redirects to and from the OAuth providers and manage the user's authentication state (e.g., using React Context or a state management library).
    *   **API Service:** Create a typed API client (`src/api/apiClient.ts`) to interact with the backend endpoints.
    *   **State Management:** Manage global state like user info and health records.

## Phase 3: Integration &amp; Advanced Features

This final phase connects all the pieces and implements the advanced functionalities.

1.  **AI Integration:**
    *   On the backend, create a service that communicates with the OpenAI API.
    *   When the `/records/:id/summarize` endpoint is hit, this service will send the record's content to OpenAI and store the returned summary in the database.

2.  **Data Visualization:**
    *   On the frontend, use a library like `Chart.js` or `Recharts` to create interactive charts that visualize trends from the health data (this assumes some structured data can be extracted or is present).

3.  **Security &amp; Compliance:**
    *   Implement secure file uploads with validation.
    *   Use environment variables (`.env`) for all sensitive keys.
    *   Ensure all data transfer is over HTTPS.
    *   Add middleware on the backend to protect routes, ensuring only authenticated users can access their data.
